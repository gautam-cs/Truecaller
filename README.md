# Service to get the longest prefix

#Algorith and data structure

* Create a trie data structures using the input words from given file
* Trie creation will not be on runtime. It will inmemory.
* Total alphabet number size will be 62 (26 small letter, 26 capital letter & 10 integers)
* Create a function which will return the longest prefix based on trie search

## Code Structure
* Place service in app/service
* Place constants in app/constants. They should not depend on any other internal app package
* Add more testcase inside the defined constants file
* Place test function in app/testing

## usage of go routine
* running the test cases for different input concurrently

```bash
go get -u
go build
```
